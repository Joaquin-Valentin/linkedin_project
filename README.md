Data analytics personal project: webscraping data analyst job postings on LinkedIn to analyze most common skills and popular tech stacks

I built a Selenium web driver to look for data analyst positions in Spain, in order to analyze the companies, and the most common skills data analysts need to have to enter the field. This project is for personal purposes only, I don't intend to sell this data or make profit from it.
